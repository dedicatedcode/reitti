   cd reitti
   ```

2. Start all services (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Reitti)
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`

4. Create your first user account through the web interface

### Development Setup

For development or custom deployments:

1. Start infrastructure services
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgis rabbitmq
   ```

2. Build and run the application
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`

### Building Docker Image

```bash
# Build the application
mvn clean package

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t reitti/reitti:latest .
```

### Initial Configuration

After starting the application:

1. **Create User Account**: Set up your first user account
2. **Generate API Token**: Create an API token in Settings → API Tokens for mobile app integration
3. **Configure Geocoding**: Add geocoding services in Settings → Geocoding for address resolution
4. **Import Data**: Upload your location data via Settings → Import Data
5. **Set up Mobile Apps**: Configure OwnTracks or GPSLogger for real-time tracking

## Docker Deployment

This [repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/dedicatedcode/reitti/) contains Docker images for the Reitti application.

### Production Deployment

For production use, we recommend using the provided docker-compose configuration:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull dedicatedcode/reitti:latest

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f reitti
```

### Standalone Docker Usage

```bash
# Run standalone with environment variables
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e POSTGIS_HOST=postgres \
  -e POSTGIS_PORT=5432 \
  -e POSTGIS_DB=reittidb \
  -e POSTGIS_USER=reitti \
  -e POSTGIS_PASSWORD=reitti \
  -e RABBITMQ_HOST=rabbitmq \
  -e RABBITMQ_PORT=5672 \
  -e RABBITMQ_USER=reitti \
  -e RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=reitti \
  -e REDIS_HOST=redis \
  -e REDIS_PORT=6379 \
  -e REDIS_PASSWORD= \
  -e REDIS_DATABASE=0 \
  dedicatedcode/reitti:latest
```

## Data Flow & Architecture

### Location Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Location data enters the system via:
   - File uploads (GPX, Google Takeout, GeoJSON)
   - Real-time mobile app integration (OwnTracks, GPSLogger)
   - REST API endpoints

2. **Queue Processing**: Data is queued in RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing:
   - Raw location points are validated and stored
   - Processing jobs are distributed across workers
   - Queue status is monitored in real-time

3. **Analysis & Detection**: Processing workers analyze the data to:
   - Detect significant places where you spend time
   - Identify trips between locations
   - Determine transport modes (walking, cycling, driving)
   - Calculate distances and durations

4. **Storage & Indexing**: Results are stored in PostgreSQL with:
   - Spatial indexing for efficient geographic queries
   - Temporal indexing for timeline operations
   - User data isolation and security

5. **Visualization**: Web interface displays processed data as:
   - Interactive timeline with visits and trips
   - Map visualization with location markers
   - Photo integration showing images taken at locations
   - Statistical summaries and insights

### Mobile App Integration

Configure mobile apps for automatic location tracking:

- **OwnTracks**: Privacy-focused location sharing
- **GPSLogger**: Lightweight Android GPS logging
- **Custom Apps**: Use the REST API for custom integrations

### Photo Integration

Connect with Immich photo servers to:
- Display photos taken at specific locations
- Show images on the timeline map
- Browse photo galleries by location and date

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with spatial extensions
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf, JavaScript
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Testcontainers
