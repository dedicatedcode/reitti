> [!WARNING]  
> To prevent an issue where the photon service downloads the entire planet's data (a very large file!), please update your docker-compose.yml file. This affects users who set up Reitti using our Docker Compose file before 2025-09-08. The photon service has renamed the COUNTRY_CODE variable to REGION.
> What to do:
> - Option A: Download the latest docker-compose.yml from the repository.
> - Option B: Manually edit your existing docker-compose.yml and change the COUNTRY_CODE environment variable to REGION in the photon service definition.
> For more details, you can see the exact changes in this [commit](https://github.com/dedicatedcode/reitti/commit/b2416892a48c15793a39d11c305b500c2077a9d3). We recommend making this change before you next pull any images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 24 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL database with spatial extensions (PostGIS)
- RabbitMQ for message processing
- Redis for caching

### Quick Start with Docker

The easiest way to get started is using Docker Compose:

1. Get the docker compose file
   ```bash
   mkdir reitti
   cd reitti
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dedicatedcode/reitti/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
   ```
   or manually downloading it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dedicatedcode/reitti/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml)
2. Adjust the compose file to your needs
   
   Pay special attention to the Photon `REGION`. This should match your main location.
   
4. Start all services (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis and Reitti)
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`

6. Login with admin:admin

**Note for ARM64 users (Apple Silicon, etc.):** Until [postgis/docker-postgis#216](https://github.com/postgis/docker-postgis/issues/216) is fixed by the PostGIS team, users wanting to run Reitti on ARM64 platforms need to change the PostGIS image in the docker-compose file from `image: postgis/postgis:17-3.5-alpine` to `image: imresamu/postgis:17-3.5-alpine`.

### Development Setup

For development or custom deployments:

1. Start infrastructure services
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d postgis rabbitmq
   ```

2. Build and run the application
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`

Default username and password is `admin`

### Building Docker Image

```bash
# Build the application
mvn clean package

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t reitti/reitti:latest .
```

### Initial Configuration

After starting the application:

1. **Generate API Token**: Create an API token in Settings → API Tokens for mobile app integration
2. **Configure Geocoding**: Add geocoding services in Settings → Geocoding for address resolution
3. **Import Data**: Upload your location data via Settings → Import Data
4. **Set up Mobile Apps**: Configure OwnTracks or GPSLogger for real-time tracking

## Docker Deployment

This [repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/dedicatedcode/reitti/) contains Docker images for the Reitti application.

### Production Deployment

## Data Flow & Architecture

### Location Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Location data enters the system via:
   - File uploads (GPX, Google Takeout, GeoJSON)
   - Real-time mobile app integration (OwnTracks, GPSLogger)
   - REST API endpoints

2. **Queue Processing**: Data is queued in RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing:
   - Raw location points are validated and stored
   - Processing jobs are distributed across workers
   - Queue status is monitored in real-time

3. **Analysis & Detection**: Processing workers analyze the data to:
   - Detect significant places where you spend time
   - Identify trips between locations
   - Determine transport modes (walking, cycling, driving)
   - Calculate distances and durations

4. **Storage & Indexing**: Results are stored in PostgreSQL with:
   - Spatial indexing for efficient geographic queries
   - Temporal indexing for timeline operations
   - User data isolation and security

5. **Visualization**: Web interface displays processed data as:
   - Interactive timeline with visits and trips
   - Map visualization with location markers
   - Photo integration showing images taken at locations
   - Statistical summaries and insights

### Mobile App Integration

Configure mobile apps for automatic location tracking:

- **OwnTracks**: Privacy-focused location sharing
- **GPSLogger**: Lightweight Android GPS logging
- **Custom Apps**: Use the REST API for custom integrations

### Photo Integration

Connect with Immich photo servers to:
- Display photos taken at specific locations
- Show images on the timeline map
- Browse photo galleries by location and date

## Reverse Geocoding Options

Reitti supports multiple approaches for reverse geocoding (converting coordinates to human-readable addresses). You can choose the option that best fits your privacy, performance, and storage requirements.

### Option 1: Self-hosted Photon (Recommended)

The included docker-compose.yml configuration provides a local Photon instance for complete privacy and optimal performance.

**Included Configuration:**
```yaml
photon:
  image: rtuszik/photon-docker:1.0.0
  environment:
    - UPDATE_STRATEGY=PARALLEL
    - REGION=de
  volumes:
    - photon-data:/photon/data
  ports:
    - "2322:2322"
```

**Storage Requirements:**
- **Country-specific**: 1-10GB depending on country size
- **Global dataset**: ~200GB for the complete worldwide index
- **PARALLEL mode**: Doubles storage requirements during updates (400GB total for global)

**Configuration Options:**
- **REGION**: Set to your main country code (e.g., `de`, `us`, `fr`) to save space
- **UPDATE_STRATEGY=PARALLEL**: Faster updates but requires double storage space
- **Remove REGION**: Download complete global dataset for worldwide coverage

**Benefits:**
- Complete privacy - no external API calls
- Fastest response times with no rate limits
- No dependency on external service availability
- No API usage fees or quotas

### Option 2: External Geocoding Services Only

Remove the Photon service from docker-compose.yml and rely solely on configured external geocoding services.

**To disable Photon:**
1. Remove the `photon` service from docker-compose.yml
2. Remove `PHOTON_BASE_URL` environment variable from the reitti service
3. Configure external geocoding services in Settings → Geocoding

**Supported Services:**
- Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)
- Custom geocoding APIs
- Multiple services with automatic failover

**Benefits:**
- No local storage requirements
- Immediate setup without data downloads
- Access to multiple geocoding providers

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Default)

Use both Photon and external services for maximum reliability.

**How it works:**
1. Photon is tried first for fast local geocoding
2. External services are used as fallback if Photon returns no results
3. Automatic failover ensures continuous operation

**Configuration:**
- Keep Photon service in docker-compose.yml
- Configure additional geocoding services in Settings → Geocoding
- Services are tried in order with automatic error handling

### Choosing the Right Option

| Requirement     | Photon Only      | External Only          | Hybrid               |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Privacy**     | ✅ Complete       | ❌ Limited              | ⚠️ Partial           |
| **Performance** | ✅ Fastest        | ❌ Network dependent    | ✅ Fast with fallback |
| **Storage**     | ❌ High (1-200GB) | ✅ None                 | ❌ High (1-200GB)     |
| **Setup Time**  | ❌ Hours to days  | ✅ Immediate            | ❌ Hours to days      |
| **Reliability** | ⚠️ Single point  | ⚠️ External dependency | ✅ Multiple sources   |
| **Cost**        | ✅ Free           | ⚠️ May have limits     | ✅ Free with backup   |

### Initial Setup Considerations

**For Photon:**
- Plan for significant disk space (see storage requirements above)
- Initial data download can take hours to days depending on dataset size
- Consider starting with country-specific data and expanding later
- Monitor disk space during initial setup, especially with PARALLEL mode

**For External Services:**
- Configure multiple services for redundancy
- Check rate limits and usage policies
- Consider geographic coverage of different providers

## Open ID Connect (OIDC)
Reitti supports using a third party OIDC provider for sign-ins. It provides the following environment variables which are required for OIDC authentication.

- `OIDC_ENABLED`
- `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`
- `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `OIDC_ISSUER_URI`
- `OIDC_SCOPE` (optional: should usually be set to "openid,profile")

Setting `OIDC_ENABLED = true` enables OIDC, whereas the remaining need to be found from your OIDC provider, e.g. github. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for examples.

For detailed OIDC configuration instructions and provider-specific examples, see the [OIDC documentation](https://www.dedicatedcode.com/projects/reitti/oidc/).

There are two URLs provided by reitti that you should give to your OIDC provider (see their documentation for further information on this), one of which is required.
- (Required) Callback URL: https://<your-reitti-url>/login/oauth2/code/oauth (e.g. `https://reitti.internal/login/oauth2/code/oauth`)
- (Optional) Logout callback URL: https://<your-reitti-url>/logout/connect/back-channel/oauth

The logout callback URL will allow your OIDC provider to sign you out of Reitti when you sign out from your provider. If you don't set it, you will have to manually sign out of Reitti even if you sign out from your OIDC provider.

### Login Requirements

Reitti's OIDC authentication follows a flexible user matching and creation process:

#### User Matching Process
1. **Primary Match**: First attempts to find an existing user by `external_id` (format: `{issuer}:{subject}`)
2. **Fallback Match**: If no external_id match, searches for a user with the OIDC `preferred_username`
3. **Account Linking**: When a username match is found, the account is updated with the external_id for future logins

#### User Creation
- **Automatic Registration**: When `OIDC_SIGN_UP_ENABLED=true` (default), new users are automatically created if no match is found
- **Registration Disabled**: When `OIDC_SIGN_UP_ENABLED=false`, login fails with an error if no existing user matches

#### User Data Handling
- **Username**: Set to the OIDC `preferred_username` 
- **Display Name**: Updated from OIDC `name` claim on each login
- **External ID**: Set to `{issuer}:{subject}` for permanent account linking
- **Profile URL**: Updated from OIDC `profile` claim if available
- **Avatar**: Automatically downloaded from OIDC `picture` claim if provided

#### Password Management
- **Local Login Enabled** (`DISABLE_LOCAL_LOGIN=false`): Existing passwords are preserved, allowing both OIDC and local authentication
- **Local Login Disabled** (`DISABLE_LOCAL_LOGIN=true`): Passwords are cleared from accounts to enforce OIDC-only authentication

#### Required OIDC Claims
Your OIDC provider must provide these claims for successful authentication:
- `sub` (subject) Required for external_id generation
- `preferred_username` - Required for username assignment
- `name` - Recommended for display name
- `profile` - Optional for profile URL
- `picture` - Optional for avatar download

#### Security Considerations
- External IDs are immutable once set, ensuring account security even if usernames change in the OIDC provider
- User data is updated on each login to keep information current
- Avatar downloads are performed securely with error handling for network failures

## Technologies

## Backup & Data Persistence

Reitti is designed to be mostly stateless, with all important data stored in the PostgreSQL database (with PostGIS extensions). To ensure you do not lose any critical data:

- **Backup Requirement:** Only the PostGIS database needs to be backed up regularly. This database contains all user location data, analysis results, and other persistent information.
- **Stateless Services:** All other components (RabbitMQ, Redis, Reitti application, etc.) are stateless and do not store any important data. These can be redeployed or restarted without risk of data loss.

**Recommended Backup Strategy:**
- Use standard PostgreSQL backup tools (such as `pg_dump` or physical volume snapshots) to back up your database.
- Ensure backups are performed regularly and stored securely.
- No backup is needed for RabbitMQ, Redis, or the Reitti application itself.

**Restore:**
- In case of disaster recovery, restoring the PostGIS database is sufficient to recover all user data and history.

For more details, see the [Reitti backup documentation](https://www.dedicatedcode.com/projects/reitti/backup/).
