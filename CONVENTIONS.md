- prefer htmx over javascript
- prefer reusing existing styles instead of creating new ones
- do not add inline styles except it is a one of a kind component
- when creating tests for classes, prefer the @IntegrationTest instead of mocking
- all rules presented here, are soft rules. We try to follow them but are also allowed to break them if needed
